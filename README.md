# Brain MRI Metastasis Segmentation

This project implements segmentation of brain MRI images for detecting metastasis using two architectures: Nested U-Net and Attention U-Net. The goal is to provide a web application for visualizing the segmentation results.

## Overview

- **Models Used**: Nested U-Net and Attention U-Net
- **Frameworks**: FastAPI for the backend, Streamlit for the frontend
- **Dataset**: [Specify the dataset used, e.g., TCGA Brain MRI dataset]

- the model successfully executes the images of the brain mri
- the rest api for deploying the app could not be done
- the steam.app for the model was done along with the code file
-
